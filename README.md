# Dijkstra Sweden Path Finder (University Project)

![Dij](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e688c5-2c4a-41ec-a990-5e1089c85b3c)

This Java application, developed as a university project, implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between cities in Sweden. It allows users to select a start and destination city, calculates the optimal route using priority queues, and visualizes the path with distances on a graphical map interface.

## Features
- Interactive selection of start and destination cities.
- Visualizes the shortest path and its distance on a map.
- Efficient route calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the Java application.
3. Select start and destination cities to find the shortest route.
4. Explore the graphical representation of the route and its distance on the map.

## Usage
- Click on cities to set them as start or destination points.
- View the shortest path graphically and see the calculated distance.
- Navigate through cities to understand the optimal route.
